# Source files
This folder contains all source files (`.h` and `.c`) of the project.

## Compiling
Compiling files, tests or the entire project is done using `make` from the root
directory of the repository. For help with available make-targets, simply type
`make help` in your terminal.

A list of targets and their use will also be added in the README.md of the 
[root directory](../).
